There are two principles: 1) write clear and specific instructions by using i) delimiters, e.g., triple quotes, ; ii) ask for structured output HTML, JSON. 2) Give the model time to think either i) specify the steps to complete a task; ii) instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion
